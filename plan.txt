-> think up idea => est. 60 minutes - took 50 (11:00 -> 11:50)
-> rest of plan => est. 30 minutes - took 10 (11:50 -> 12:00)

-> think up a name => est. 15 minutes - took 15 (12:00 -> 12:15)
-> make project => est. 15 minutes - took 2 (12:15 -> 12:17)
-> push to git => est. 15 minutes -  took 32 (12:17 -> 12:44)

-> make worlds crappiest planet and black hole assets
-> get them into unity
-> get them on screen (as prefabs)

-> make a player

-> put in planet physics
	-> rotation
	-> rotation based on side
	-> bounce
	-> relative to mass

-> get the player moving

-> everything rotates around black hole
-> everything gets slowly sucked towards black hole
-> things that hit black hole get killed
-> black hole grows physically bigger
-> and this causes energy to increase
-> black hole has life / food meter
 -> http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/787137/sprite-masking.html
-> put in stops when full
	
-> player dies = game over

-> randomly generate other planets
-> randomly generate mass
-> random images
-> randomly position player
-> script create black hole

-> larger planets getting sucked into black hole bug

-> tie this together with game over
	-> regenerate level after death (r key)

-> camera moves around properly
	-> camera follow player
	-> UI sits properly at top of camera
	
-> change planet velocity back to be a single value - not a list

-> make better assets
	-> background
	-> planet
	-> black hole
	-> other planets
	-> black hole life bar
	
-> tweak player movement
	-> stronger going with the current of gravity
	
-> TWEAK: holding movement key needs to increase effective rotation velocity (if in same dir)
-> TWEAK: player needs way more mass

	
	
FREAKING OUT TODO: 
-> tiling background
-> put in new bar
-> put in new text
-> minimum on bounce
-> proper arena bounds

-> don't spawn too close

-> tweak way down rotational gravity for planets

-> wider background
-> bar background no overlap

-> player can still go way out of bounds

-> tweak player movement

-> make sounds effects
-> make music

-> AI - survive
- AI - attack

-> fix restart

- bug where everything goes weird

- music v2

-> tweak controls even more


- BUG: rotation same with every planet at start

- splash page instructions 


- MORE: other planets

- black hole a bit weaker closer in?





- indicators for stuff

- keep writing this list


- points



- black hole grows smoothly
	- with easing?
	- same with fullness bar -> http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/56555/increasing-an-gamobjects-transformlocalscale-by-1.html#answer-56558

- BUG: status stuff displays under planets
- FEATURE: put in indicators to show where other planets are

- too far from the stage = slowly drawn back in
- try to get stable orbits running

- if the planet getting sucked into the black hole's smaller than the hole - just suck it in (maybe shrink a bit)
- otherwise, smooth it out - it looks crap

- make music
- get music in game
- make sound effects
- get in game

- generate sacrificial lamb to get eaten first

- levels?

- new name from http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/soundgarden/blackholesun.html ?



- asteroids and shit

- planets have speech bubbles
- planets scream as they die

- shakey cam on still
- cam shakes more on hits

- particle affects
